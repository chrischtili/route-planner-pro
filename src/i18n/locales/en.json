Stage Planning (daily kilometers, driving time, breaks every 2-3 hours, alternative route and brief reasoning if necessary).\n\n2. Overnights (specific camping/pitches (and alternatives) with a short description; provide links and rough price ranges where possible, but mark prices as guidelines).\n\n3. Highlights & Activities (Top 3 per stage, briefly with costs/opening hours if known).\n\n4. Practical Tips (navigation, disposal, emergency information).\n\n5. Best Travel Time & Duration (short section).\n\n6. Service on the go (refueling, supermarkets, workshops).\n\n7. Additional Info (budget orientation, sustainability, health, connectivity).\n\n8. Tech & Equipment (short checklist, app recommendations).\n\n9. Flexibility (alternative routes, legal information on wild camping, tools for further optimization).\n\nImportant: Use your internal map knowledge, if available, to roughly calculate distances and typical driving times between stages. State distances in km and driving times in hours/minutes and label them as estimates (e.g. \"approx. 230 km / 3:00-3:30 h\"). Avoid exact precision if you do not have access to current routing data, and explicitly ask me to finally check the route in the GPS (e.g. Google Maps, Here, Garmin, OpenStreetMap app).\n\nGPX File: At the end of the response, generate only the GPX-XML data for this route in GPX 1.1 format. Include the start, all stages, overnight stays, and the destination as waypoints (<wpt>) and the entire route as a track (<trk>). No explanations for the XML."
